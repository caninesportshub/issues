# Canine Sports Hub – Feature Requests & Bug Reports

![Canine Sports Hub Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/120x120.png?text=CSH) <!-- Replace with your actual logo if you have one -->

**Welcome!**  
This is the **public issue tracker** for **Canine Sports Hub** — the essential tool for finding, registering, participating in, and hosting canine sporting events (Flyball, Barn Hunt, Dock Diving, Agility, and more).

**Important:**  
This repository contains **NO source code**.  
The actual web application and mobile apps (iOS/Android) are kept in **private repositories** to protect the project.  
Here you can safely report bugs, suggest improvements, or request new features — **no GitHub login is required to view existing issues**, but you'll need to sign in to create one.

## Why this separate repo?
We want to make it easy for competitors, judges, event organizers, and dog sport enthusiasts to share feedback without needing access to the private code.  
Your input directly helps improve timing, scoring, registration, real-time updates, offline support, and the overall experience!

## How to Contribute
Before creating a new issue, please:
- [Search existing issues](https://github.com/caninesportshub/issues/issues) — your question or idea might already be there!
- Be as detailed as possible — good reports save everyone time and help us fix things faster.

We have two friendly templates to choose from:

### 🐛 Report a Bug

Examples: timing glitches during a Flyball race, sync issues on mobile, registration errors, UI problems on tablet, etc.

## Tips for Great Issues
- Use a clear, descriptive **title** (e.g., "Timer freezes during low-network Flyball race on Android tablet")
- Include as much detail as possible:
  - What you were doing
  - What happened (and what you expected)
  - Device / OS / Browser
  - Screenshots or short videos (drag & drop them right into the issue!)
  - App version (check in settings/about)
- If reporting a bug, steps to reproduce are super helpful
- **Do NOT** include sensitive information (passwords, personal details, payment info, etc.)

## Questions or Need Help?
- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/caninesportshub/issues/issues) first
